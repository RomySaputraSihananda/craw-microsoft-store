    "reviewText": "I installed this for the single purpose of creating an account for later, and to follow a couple of my friends. however, this app is fundamentally flawed. \ryou CANNOT follow ANYONE with this app. in order to ACTUALLY follow someone, I had to install an android emulator, and then install tiktok on THAT because whenever I try to click \"follow\" on browser, or this app (which is just the browser experience except it can spy on you more, and takes up room on your computer) it will gray out the follow button as if you followed them, but if you refresh it is back to red, and the person is never added to your following list. absolutely a waste of time, and I regret ever even TRYING to use tiktok. its all mind numbing drivel anyway...
